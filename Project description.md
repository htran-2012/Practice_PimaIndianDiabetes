# Project: Pima Indian Diabetes dataset

Practice performing machine learning on an open-source dataset
Using logistic regression

## 1. Define problem


#### What is the problem?

To predict whether a case develop diabetes or not

#### Why doing this?

Diabetes mellitus is a global health problem

To predict if a certain case has a high chace to develop into DM is essential in prevention and potential treatment


#### How to do this?

Using logistic regression 



## 2. Understand dataset and variables:

Population: Pima Indian woman- AZ. Because of high incidence rate of diabetes. 

768 instances.

8 attributes. Attributes was chosen because they have been found to be significant risk factors
Attributes include:
* Number of times pregnant
* Plasma Glucose Concentration at 2 hours in an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT)(mg/dL)
* Diastolic Blood Pressure(mmHg)
* Triceps Skin Fold Thickness(mm)
* 2-hr Serum Insulin(uU/mL)
* Body Mass Index-BMI(kg/m2)
* Diabetes Pedigree Function (DBF)(synthesis of DM history and genetic relationship)
(developed by Jack W.Smith, et al.)
* Age(years)

Target variable/ Class variable:
Test positive for DM = 1
Test negative for DM = 0
